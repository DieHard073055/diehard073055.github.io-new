# Introduction
 Welcome to my blog! My name is Eshan Shafeeq, and I've been working as a software engineer since 2015. In the early years of my career, I worked on IoT projects, building everything from home automation systems to black boxes for cars. Later, I moved into the exciting world of nano satellites.

Recently, I made the move into the exciting world of crypto as a Rust engineer. I've been fascinated by the power and efficiency of Rust, and I'm excited to be working on cutting-edge Web3 projects. My experience ranges from smart contracts, writing scripts to interact with smart contracts, to Rust development. With a passion for learning and exploring new technologies, I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to push the boundaries of what's possible.

In this blog, I'll be sharing my journey as a Rust developer, providing insights into the latest developments in the Rust ecosystem and exploring the intersection of Rust and Web3. Whether you're a seasoned Rustacean or just getting started, I hope you'll find my blog to be a valuable resource for your own Rust adventures.
